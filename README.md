## Disclaimer
- This is a frontend project made using Spotify API. Note:- You may not be able to play the music as the API requires a premium account for the API call. I have not renewed my premium account after the initial development. However, I can very do it if required. Also it has not been made responsive intentionally as the motive was to showcase my capability with APIs and render beautiful UIs.
- To check my development accumen , you could check out my fully responsive [Youtube Frontend](https://divyanshu-yt-frontend.web.app/). You may checkout the Github source code [here](https://github.com/Divy-Codes/divyanshu-yt-frontend).


## Source Code Explanation
- Context API was used for state management.
- All the methods have been concentrated in one file called `reducer.js` . This makes it easy to debug and scale the application further.
- Used styled components for faster developments. This choice was made as the CSS wasn't very complex and could have been written in the same files.
